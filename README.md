# survivor-saving
Back in my first year and second semester at the University of Utah (right before and during COVID), I took a Python course.
Being a huge Survivor fan I used what I learned to build this Survivor project to continue to teach myself Python (and maybe even one day share it with fellow Survivor fans with an interest for coding).
This is an older version featuring a lot of what I did before and during COVID so here's a few rules.
How it works to similar to my others, just type based on how the program tells you to type and please, upper case and lower case matters, if you type something that is meant to be lower case as upper case, it won't work and vice versa. Type how it is shown. Will update this with my newer version that I've been updating over the years very soon. Thanks and enjoy!
