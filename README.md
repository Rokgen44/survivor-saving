# survivor-saving
With Survivor coming back, I'm posting a Python save component version of my survivor coding.
How it works to similar to my others, just type based on how the program tells you to type and please, upper case and lower case matters, if you type something that is meant to be lower case as upper case, it won't work and vice versa. Type how it is shown. Thanks and enjoy!
